# app

A project for "Flutter Create".
This app can run both in Android and iOS device. But it is specially targetted for Android devices.

## Getting Started

'main.dart' file is the main file for this application. The two other files 'home.dart' and 'dictionary.dart' are the two different pages of this application. 

All the images are present in the 'images' folder. 'pubspec.yaml' file is also present with this app.

For running this app I would recommend to type this command 
"flutter run --enable-software-rendering".

The landing page of this app will be the Home page, then on clicking the icons of books in the Bar Navigation the dictionary page will open.
